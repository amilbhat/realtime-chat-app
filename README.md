## Project Overview

This project is a real-time chat application that allows users to create accounts, log in securely, and engage in real-time conversations with other users. It's built using the following technologies:

- **React**: Used for building the user interface and components.
- **React Router**: For handling routing and navigation within the application.
- **Firebase**: Utilized for user authentication, real-time database functionality, and cloud storage for media files.

Each component in the application has a separate CSS file for easy style customization.

## Features

- User authentication with Firebase Authentication.
- Real-time chat functionality using Firebase Realtime Database.
- Secure and user-friendly interface.
- Routing with React Router for a seamless user experience.

   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",

     storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
     messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
     appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
   };

   export default firebaseConfig;
   ```

6. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Your application should now be running locally at `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your web browser to use the chat application.
